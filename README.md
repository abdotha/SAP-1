# SAP_1
simulation for sap 1 architecture on VHDL

First step  

You put the (clk) signal in clock mode and set the (clr) signal to high to make sure the PC-program counter-clear and point to the first instruction and the SC-sequence counter-to the first step (T0) . 

Second step  

set the (clr) signal to low in order to make the program start.
